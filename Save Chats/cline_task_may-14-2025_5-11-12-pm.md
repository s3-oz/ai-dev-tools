PLAN MODE
In this mode you should focus on information gathering, asking questions, and architecting a solution. Once you have a plan, use the plan_mode_respond tool to engage in a conversational back and forth with the user. Do not use the plan_mode_respond tool until you've gathered all the information you need e.g. with read_file or ask_followup_question.
(Remember: If it seems the user wants you to use tools only available in Act Mode, you should ask the user to "toggle to Act mode" (use those words) - they will have to manually do this themselves with the Plan/Act toggle button below. You do not have the ability to switch to Act Mode yourself, and must wait for the user to do it themselves once they are satisfied with the plan. You also cannot present an option to toggle to Act mode, as this will be something you need to direct the user to do manually themselves.)

**Assistant:**

<thinking>
I need to estimate how many hours of work it has taken to develop this project. To do this effectively, I'll need to gather information about the project's scope, complexity, and components. Let me analyze what I can see from the file structure and then determine what additional information I might need.

From the file structure, I can see this appears to be a Next.js application for a simulation studio business (SimStudio) with booking functionality. It includes:

1. A booking system with multiple steps (BookingFormStep1.tsx, BookingFormStep2.tsx, BookingFormStep3.tsx)
2. Admin functionality (BookingsManager.tsx, BusinessHoursForm.tsx, CoachProfileManager.tsx, etc.)
3. Payment integration (likely with Square based on files like square.ts, SquarePaymentForm.tsx)
4. Email notification system (email templates, email-utils.ts)
5. Authentication system (auth components, NextAuth integration)
6. Database integration (likely Supabase based on db-supabase.ts)
7. Various UI components and layouts

To make a more accurate estimate, I should look at some key files to understand their complexity and the features implemented. Let me start by examining some of the core files.

To estimate the development hours for this project, I'll need to analyze its scope, complexity, and components. From the file structure, I can see this is a Next.js application for a simulation studio business with several sophisticated systems integrated.

Let me gather more information by examining some key files to understand the project's complexity better. I'll start by looking at the technical plan and implementation summary to get an overview of the project.

First, let's look at the TechnicalPlan.md file:

Do not use the plan_mode_respond tool until you've gathered all the information you need e.g. with read_file or ask_followup_question.
(Remember: If it seems the user wants you to use tools only available in Act Mode, you should ask the user to "toggle to Act mode" (use those words) - they will have to manually do this themselves with the Plan/Act toggle button below. You do not have the ability to switch to Act Mode yourself, and must wait for the user to do it themselves once they are satisfied with the plan. You also cannot present an option to toggle to Act mode, as this will be something you need to direct the user to do manually themselves.)

# Migration from Supabase Auth to NextAuth

This document outlines the changes made to migrate the authentication system from Supabase Auth to NextAuth.js.

## Why NextAuth?

- **Cost Savings**: Supabase Auth requires a Pro plan for SSO features, while NextAuth provides these features for free.
- **Flexibility**: NextAuth offers more authentication providers and customization options.
- **Integration**: Better integration with Next.js and the React ecosystem.

## Key Changes

### 1. NextAuth Configuration

- Created a NextAuth API route at `pages/api/auth/[...nextauth].ts`
- Configured both Credentials and Email providers
- Set up JWT-based session management
- Created a custom adapter for Supabase database integration

### 2. Authentication Context

- Updated `contexts/AuthContext.tsx` to use NextAuth's session management
- Maintained the same interface for backward compatibility with existing components
- Added synchronization between NextAuth sessions and our database user records

### 3. Authentication Pages

- Updated login and register pages to use NextAuth's signIn function
- Created additional pages for NextAuth's authentication flow:
  - `pages/auth/verify-request.tsx`: Shown when a magic link is sent
  - `pages/auth/error.tsx`: Shown when an authentication error occurs
  - `pages/auth/logout.tsx`: Shown after signing out

### 4. Protected Routes

- Updated `components/auth/AuthGuard.tsx` to use NextAuth's useSession hook
- Maintained the same protection behavior for authenticated routes

### 5. Environment Variables

- Added NextAuth-specific environment variables to `.env.local` and `.env.example`

## Testing

- Created debug pages to help troubleshoot authentication issues:
  - `pages/auth-test.tsx`: Simple test page for NextAuth integration
  - `pages/auth-debug.tsx`: Detailed debugging page with session information

## Known Issues

- The transition between authentication states may require a page reload in some cases
- Email provider requires proper SMTP configuration for production use

## Future Improvements

- Add more authentication providers (Google, GitHub, etc.)
- Implement role-based access control
- Enhance user profile management

# Square Payment Integration Implementation Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the implementation of Square payment integration for the SimStudio booking system. The integration uses Square's hosted Checkout solution to securely process payments without collecting sensitive payment information directly in our application.

## Implemented Features

1. **Square Checkout Integration**
   - Implemented Square Checkout API for secure, hosted payment processing
   - Created payment link generation endpoint
   - Added payment verification and success handling
   - Configured redirect URLs for seamless user experience

2. **Database Updates**
   - Added `square_customer_id` field to the users table in database.types.ts
   - Created migration script to handle database updates
   - Added temporary users table for guest checkout flow

3. **Payment Processing**
   - Created checkout link generation API endpoint
   - Implemented payment verification endpoint
   - Added metadata handling for tracking orders and users

4. **Authentication Integration**
   - Maintained Supabase authentication system
   - Implemented hybrid approach for user account management
   - Added functionality to create or update Square customer records when users sign in

5. **Guest Checkout Flow**
   - Implemented pre-checkout minimal information collection
   - Created temporary user records for guest users
   - Added post-payment account creation process
   - Added clear messaging about account creation during the checkout process

## Key Files Created/Modified

### New Files
- `lib/square.ts` - Square client initialization
- `pages/api/create-checkout.ts` - Checkout link generation endpoint
- `pages/api/verify-payment.ts` - Payment verification endpoint
- `pages/checkout/success.tsx` - Success page for handling Square redirects
- `lib/migrations/add-temp-users-table.js` - Migration script for temporary users table

### Modified Files
- `components/CheckoutForm.tsx` - Updated to use Square Checkout instead of direct payment form
- `contexts/AuthContext.tsx` - Updated to include Square customer management
- `lib/database.types.ts` - Added square_customer_id field to users table
- `package.json` - Added Square SDK and migration script
- `.env.example` - Added Square environment variables
- `PaymentAuthIntegrationPlan.md` - Updated implementation status

## Environment Variables

The following environment variables need to be set in `.env.local`:

```
# Square Configuration
SQUARE_ACCESS_TOKEN=your-square-access-token
SQUARE_LOCATION_ID=your-square-location-id
SQUARE_ENVIRONMENT=sandbox  # or 'production'
NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000  # Your application URL for redirects
MERCHANT_SUPPORT_EMAIL=support@simstudio.com  # Optional: Support email shown on checkout page
```

## Testing

The implementation uses Square's hosted checkout pages in all environments:

- The CheckoutForm component redirects users to Square's hosted checkout page
- Square handles all payment information collection and processing
- After payment, users are redirected back to the application
- A detailed testing guide is available in `SquareTestingGuide.md` with test scenarios

For testing in the sandbox environment, you can use the following test card numbers on Square's checkout page:
- Visa: 4111 1111 1111 1111
- Mastercard: 5105 1051 0510 5100
- American Express: 3782 822463 10005
- Discover: 6011 1111 1111 1117

Use any future expiration date, any 3-digit CVV (4 digits for Amex), and any 5-digit postal code.

## User Authentication Flow

The implementation uses a hybrid approach for user authentication:

1. **For Logged-in Users:**
   - User logs in through existing Supabase auth
   - User selects services/packages and proceeds to checkout
   - Application creates a Square Checkout link with the user's ID in metadata
   - User is redirected to Square Checkout
   - After payment, Square redirects back to the success page
   - Success page verifies payment and adds credits to the user's account

2. **For Guest Users:**
   - User selects services/packages and proceeds to checkout
   - Application collects minimal information (name, email) before checkout
   - Application creates a temporary user record
   - Application creates a Square Checkout link with a reference ID in metadata
   - User is redirected to Square Checkout
   - After payment, Square redirects back to the success page
   - Success page verifies payment, completes account creation in Supabase, and adds credits

## Next Steps

1. **Get Square Location ID**
   - Log in to Square Developer Dashboard
   - Navigate to Sandbox Test Account > Locations
   - Copy the Location ID and update `.env.local`

2. **Test Payment Flow**
   - Start the development server with `npm run dev`
   - Navigate to a page that uses the CheckoutForm component
   - Test the payment process in the sandbox environment

3. **Production Deployment**
   - Update environment variables for production
   - Set `SQUARE_ENVIRONMENT=production`
   - Replace sandbox credentials with production credentials
   - Update `NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL` to your production URL

## Benefits of Square Checkout

1. **Reduced PCI Compliance Scope**: Square handles all the payment data collection, significantly reducing PCI compliance requirements
2. **Enhanced Security**: Payment information never touches your servers
3. **Simplified Implementation**: No need to manage card input fields or tokenization
4. **Mobile-Optimized Experience**: Square's checkout pages are designed for all devices
5. **Built-in Features**: Support for various payment methods, shipping fees, custom fields, etc.

## Notes

- The Square Checkout API creates a hosted payment page that handles all payment information collection
- User information is securely passed between the application and Square using metadata
- Error handling is in place to gracefully handle payment failures and verification issues
- The implementation maintains compatibility with the existing Supabase authentication system

# Cancellation Approval System & Coaching Credit Refund

## Overview

This document provides a comprehensive summary of the enhanced cancellation approval system and its integration with the coaching credit refund system for SimStudio.

## Key Components

The complete solution consists of the following components:

1. **Enhanced Cancellation Process**
   - User-initiated cancellation requests with required reason
   - Admin approval workflow for all cancellations
   - Special handling for late cancellations (within 24 hours)
   - Email notifications for users and admins

2. **CoachCredit System**
   - Store coaching fees from cancelled bookings as CoachCredit
   - Automatically apply CoachCredit to future bookings
   - Maintain separate tracking from Simulator Hours

3. **Admin Control Panel**
   - Dedicated interface for reviewing cancellation requests
   - Options for different credit return levels (full, partial, none)
   - Ability to approve or reject cancellations with comments

## Implementation Documents

The implementation is detailed in the following documents:

1. [CoachingCreditRefund.md](./CoachingCreditRefund.md) - Outlines the approach for handling coaching fee refunds as account credit
2. [CancellationApprovalSystem.md](./CancellationApprovalSystem.md) - Technical implementation plan for the cancellation system
3. [CancellationWorkflow.md](./CancellationWorkflow.md) - Visual workflow diagram and process steps
4. [CancellationUIMockups.md](./CancellationUIMockups.md) - UI mockups and email templates

## Business Benefits

This integrated system provides several key benefits:

1. **Improved User Experience**
   - Clear cancellation process with transparent communication
   - Fair handling of refunds with account credit system
   - Consistent email notifications throughout the process

2. **Better Business Control**
   - Admin approval prevents abuse of the cancellation system
   - Flexibility to handle special circumstances
   - Ability to enforce policies while maintaining customer satisfaction

3. **Financial Advantages**
   - No direct monetary refunds required
   - Keeps money within the SimStudio ecosystem as CoachCredit
   - Encourages future bookings through available credits

4. **Operational Efficiency**
   - Streamlined process for handling cancellations
   - Clear audit trail of cancellation requests and decisions
   - Automated email notifications reduce manual communication

## Implementation Approach

The recommended implementation approach is to develop both the cancellation approval system and the coaching credit refund system together in the following phases:

### Phase 1: Database & Backend Changes
- Update database schema for both systems
- Modify the bookings API to handle cancellation requests
- Implement the CoachCredit system for coaching cancellations

### Phase 2: Admin Interface
- Create the cancellation approval interface
- Add options for handling different types of refunds
- Implement the refund processing logic

### Phase 3: User Interface
- Update the cancellation flow in the user account page
- Add messaging about the approval process
- Display Simulator Hours and CoachCredit from cancelled bookings

### Phase 4: Email Notifications
- Implement all notification templates
- Set up the notification triggers

## Next Steps

1. Review and finalize the implementation plan
2. Prioritize development tasks
3. Begin implementation with database schema changes
4. Develop and test each component incrementally
5. Deploy the complete system

## Future Enhancements

Potential future enhancements to consider:

1. **Automated Approvals**
   - Automatically approve cancellations that meet certain criteria
   - Reduce admin workload for standard cases

2. **Cancellation Analytics**
   - Track cancellation reasons and patterns
   - Identify opportunities for business improvement

3. **Partial Cancellations**
   - Allow users to cancel just the coaching portion of a booking
   - Keep the simulator booking intact

4. **Tiered Cancellation Policies**
   - Different policies based on user membership level
   - Special handling for VIP customers or frequent users

   - Select "Create new calendar"
   - Name it "SimStudio Bookings"
   - Add a description and set the timezone to Australia/Melbourne
   - Click "Create calendar"

2. **Create Simulator Calendars**:
   - Create a separate calendar for each simulator (e.g., "SimStudio - Simulator 1")
   - Repeat for all four simulators

3. **Share Calendars with Service Account**:
   - For each calendar:
     - Click the three dots next to the calendar name
     - Select "Settings and sharing"
     - Under "Share with specific people," click "Add people"
     - Enter your service account email (ends with @project-id.iam.gserviceaccount.com)
     - Set permission to "Make changes to events"
     - Click "Send"

4. **Share Calendars with Admin**:
   - For each calendar:
     - Under "Share with specific people," click "Add people"
     - Enter the admin's email (e.g., chris@simstudio.com.au)
     - Set permission to "Make changes to events"
     - Click "Send"

5. **For Coaches**:
   - For internal coaches (like Chris who is also an admin):
     - Share the relevant calendars with their email
   - For external coaches (like Shane):
     - Option 1: Create a dedicated calendar for each coach and share it with them
     - Option 2: Use calendar invites for each booking (recommended for external coaches)

## Implementation

### 1. Environment Variables

Add these to your `.env` file and deployment environment:

```
# Google Calendar API credentials
GOOGLE_CLIENT_EMAIL=service-account-email@project-id.iam.gserviceaccount.com
GOOGLE_PRIVATE_KEY=-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\n...\n-----END PRIVATE KEY-----\n

# Admin calendar
ADMIN_CALENDAR_ID=admin-calendar-id@group.calendar.google.com

# Simulator-specific calendars
SIMULATOR_1_CALENDAR_ID=simulator1-calendar-id@group.calendar.google.com
SIMULATOR_2_CALENDAR_ID=simulator2-calendar-id@group.calendar.google.com
SIMULATOR_3_CALENDAR_ID=simulator3-calendar-id@group.calendar.google.com
SIMULATOR_4_CALENDAR_ID=simulator4-calendar-id@group.calendar.google.com
```

### 2. Database Schema Update

Add columns to store calendar event IDs:

```sql
-- Add these columns to the bookings table
ALTER TABLE bookings 
  ADD COLUMN admin_calendar_event_id TEXT,
  ADD COLUMN simulator_calendar_event_id TEXT,
  ADD COLUMN coach_calendar_event_id TEXT;
```

### 3. Google Calendar Integration Module

Create a new file `lib/google-calendar.ts`:

```typescript
import { google } from 'googleapis';
import { JWT } from 'google-auth-library';
import { supabase } from './supabase';

// Service account credentials
const CREDENTIALS = {
  client_email: process.env.GOOGLE_CLIENT_EMAIL,
  private_key: process.env.GOOGLE_PRIVATE_KEY?.replace(/\\n/g, '\n'),
};

// Initialize auth client
const auth = new JWT({
  email: CREDENTIALS.client_email,
  key: CREDENTIALS.private_key,
  scopes: ['https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar'],
});

// Create calendar client
const calendar = google.calendar({ version: 'v3', auth });

// Calendar configurations
const ADMIN_CALENDAR_ID = process.env.ADMIN_CALENDAR_ID || 'primary';
const SIMULATOR_CALENDARS = {
  1: process.env.SIMULATOR_1_CALENDAR_ID,
  2: process.env.SIMULATOR_2_CALENDAR_ID,
  3: process.env.SIMULATOR_3_CALENDAR_ID,
  4: process.env.SIMULATOR_4_CALENDAR_ID,
};
const SIMULATOR_COLORS = {
  1: '1',  // Lavender
  2: '2',  // Sage
  3: '3',  // Grape
  4: '4',  // Flamingo
};

### 4. API Integration

Update the booking API endpoints to use the calendar integration:

#### Update `pages/api/bookings.ts`:

```typescript
// In the POST method (create booking)
// After successfully creating the booking in the database:

// Create calendar events
if (!isTemporaryBooking) {
  try {
    const { createBookingEvents } = require('../../lib/google-calendar');
    
    const calendarResult = await createBookingEvents(booking);
    
    if (!calendarResult.success) {
      // Log error but don't fail the booking creation
      console.error('Failed to create calendar events:', calendarResult.error);
    }
  } catch (calendarError) {
    console.error('Error with calendar integration:', calendarError);
  }
}

// In the PUT method (update booking)
// After successfully updating the booking in the database:

// Update calendar events
try {
  const { updateBookingEvents } = require('../../lib/google-calendar');
  
  const calendarResult = await updateBookingEvents(updatedBooking);
  
  if (!calendarResult.success) {
    // Log error but don't fail the booking update
    console.error('Failed to update calendar events:', calendarResult.error);
  }
} catch (calendarError) {
  console.error('Error with calendar integration:', calendarError);
}

// In the DELETE method (cancel booking)
// Before deleting the booking, get the full booking details
const { data: booking, error: getBookingError } = await supabase
  .from('bookings')
  .select('*')
  .eq('id', bookingId)
  .single();

// Delete calendar events
try {
  const { deleteBookingEvents } = require('../../lib/google-calendar');
  await deleteBookingEvents(booking);
} catch (calendarError) {
  console.error('Error deleting calendar events:', calendarError);
}
```

#### Update `pages/api/send-booking-confirmation.ts`:

```typescript
// After preparing the email content:

// Generate iCal attachment
const { generateICalEvent } = require('../../lib/google-calendar');
const icalContent = generateICalEvent(booking);

// Add "Add to Calendar" link in the email
const calendarLink = `data:text/calendar;charset=utf8,${encodeURIComponent(icalContent)}`;
emailHtml += `
<p>
  <a href="${calendarLink}" download="SimStudio-Booking-${booking.id}.ics">
    Add to Calendar
  </a>
</p>
`;
```

## Testing and Deployment

### 1. Local Testing

1. Set up environment variables in `.env.local`
2. Test booking creation, updates, and cancellations
3. Verify events appear in the appropriate calendars
4. Test coach invitations

### 2. Production Deployment

1. Add environment variables to your hosting platform (e.g., Vercel)
2. Deploy the updated code
3. Run the database migration to add the new columns
4. Test the production deployment

## Maintenance Considerations

1. **Error Handling**: Calendar operations are wrapped in try/catch blocks to prevent booking failures if calendar integration fails
2. **Token Expiration**: Service account keys don't expire, but it's good practice to rotate them periodically
3. **Calendar Permissions**: If you add new calendars or change service accounts, remember to update sharing permissions
4. **Coach Management**: Keep the coach email mapping up to date as coaches join or leave

## Future Enhancements

1. **User Calendar Integration**: Allow users to add bookings to their personal calendars
2. **Calendar-Based Availability**: Use calendar free/busy API to check coach availability
3. **Two-Way Sync**: Listen for calendar changes and update bookings accordingly
4. **Admin Interface**: Create a UI for managing calendar settings and connections

PLAN MODE
In this mode you should focus on information gathering, asking questions, and architecting a solution. Once you have a plan, use the plan_mode_respond tool to engage in a conversational back and forth with the user. Do not use the plan_mode_respond tool until you've gathered all the information you need e.g. with read_file or ask_followup_question.
(Remember: If it seems the user wants you to use tools only available in Act Mode, you should ask the user to "toggle to Act mode" (use those words) - they will have to manually do this themselves with the Plan/Act toggle button below. You do not have the ability to switch to Act Mode yourself, and must wait for the user to do it themselves once they are satisfied with the plan. You also cannot present an option to toggle to Act mode, as this will be something you need to direct the user to do manually themselves.)

Now I have a good understanding of the project's scope, complexity, and features. Let me also look at the booking form components to understand the user interface complexity:

PLAN MODE
In this mode you should focus on information gathering, asking questions, and architecting a solution. Once you have a plan, use the plan_mode_respond tool to engage in a conversational back and forth with the user. Do not use the plan_mode_respond tool until you've gathered all the information you need e.g. with read_file or ask_followup_question.
(Remember: If it seems the user wants you to use tools only available in Act Mode, you should ask the user to "toggle to Act mode" (use those words) - they will have to manually do this themselves with the Plan/Act toggle button below. You do not have the ability to switch to Act Mode yourself, and must wait for the user to do it themselves once they are satisfied with the plan. You also cannot present an option to toggle to Act mode, as this will be something you need to direct the user to do manually themselves.)

PLAN MODE
In this mode you should focus on information gathering, asking questions, and architecting a solution. Once you have a plan, use the plan_mode_respond tool to engage in a conversational back and forth with the user. Do not use the plan_mode_respond tool until you've gathered all the information you need e.g. with read_file or ask_followup_question.
(Remember: If it seems the user wants you to use tools only available in Act Mode, you should ask the user to "toggle to Act mode" (use those words) - they will have to manually do this themselves with the Plan/Act toggle button below. You do not have the ability to switch to Act Mode yourself, and must wait for the user to do it themselves once they are satisfied with the plan. You also cannot present an option to toggle to Act mode, as this will be something you need to direct the user to do manually themselves.)

**Assistant:**

<thinking>
Now I need to estimate the development hours if an AI was doing 100% of the coding, assisted by an internet master with 25+ years of experience. This would significantly reduce the development time as the AI could generate code quickly, and the experienced developer would provide guidance, review, and make strategic decisions.

In this scenario:
1. The AI would handle all code generation, including boilerplate code, repetitive tasks, and standard implementations
2. The experienced developer would:
   - Define requirements and architecture
   - Review and validate AI-generated code
   - Make strategic decisions about technology choices
   - Handle integration points and complex logic
   - Debug and fix issues
   - Test the application

Let me recalculate the hours based on this scenario:

# SimStudio-v2 Development Hours Estimate: AI + Experienced Developer Scenario

If an AI was doing 100% of the coding with guidance from an internet master with 25+ years of experience, the development time would be significantly reduced. Here's a revised estimate based on this collaborative approach:

## Project Components and Estimated Hours

### 1. Project Setup and Architecture (10-12 hours)
- The experienced developer would define the architecture and requirements
- AI would generate the Next.js with TypeScript setup
- Database schema would be designed by the developer and implemented by AI
- Project structure would be established quickly with AI generating boilerplate

### 2. Core Booking System (20-25 hours)
- Developer would define the booking flow and validation requirements
- AI would implement the multi-step booking form
- Availability algorithms would be designed by the developer and coded by AI

## Total Estimated Hours

Adding these components together:

**Low estimate: 116 hours**
**High estimate: 143 hours**

This represents approximately 3-4 weeks of work for this collaborative approach, which is about 25-30% of the time it would take with traditional development methods.

## Key Efficiency Factors

1. **Rapid Code Generation**: AI can generate code much faster than human developers, especially for standard patterns and boilerplate.

2. **Parallel Processing**: While the developer reviews one component, the AI can be working on implementing another.

3. **Reduced Debugging Time**: With the developer's expertise guiding the AI, many common bugs would be avoided from the start.

4. **Efficient Integration**: The experienced developer would know exactly how to integrate third-party services, reducing trial and error.

5. **Streamlined Decision Making**: The developer's 25+ years of experience would lead to faster, more confident architectural decisions.

6. **Optimized Testing**: The developer would focus testing on critical paths and edge cases, while routine testing could be handled by AI.

7. **Knowledge of Best Practices**: The experienced developer would ensure industry best practices are followed without the learning curve.

## Limitations to Consider

Even with this optimized approach, some aspects would still require significant human involvement:

1. **Business Logic Validation**: Ensuring the system correctly implements business rules would require careful review.

2. **Security Considerations**: Payment processing and authentication would need expert verification.

3. **User Experience Decisions**: Strategic UX decisions would still rely on human judgment.

4. **Third-party Service Configuration**: Setting up accounts and API keys for services like Square would remain a manual process.

5. **Edge Case Handling**: Identifying and addressing unusual scenarios would benefit from human experience.

This estimate assumes a highly effective collaboration where the developer is adept at working with AI tools and can clearly communicate requirements and feedback.

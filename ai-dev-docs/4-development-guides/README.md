# Development Guides

This directory contains documentation related to development practices, coding standards, and technical guidelines for implementing the project.

## Purpose

The Development Guides serve as the reference for:

- Coding standards and best practices
- Development workflows and processes
- Environment setup and configuration
- Testing strategies and methodologies
- Debugging and troubleshooting approaches
- Performance optimization techniques
- Security implementation guidelines

## Contents

This directory should contain:

- Coding style guides
- Development environment setup instructions
- Git workflow documentation
- Testing guidelines and examples
- Code review checklists
- Debugging guides
- Performance optimization guides
- Security implementation guides
- Accessibility guidelines
- Documentation standards

## Relationship to Other Documentation

- **Architecture & Design**: Development guides implement the patterns and decisions outlined in the architecture.
- **Technical Specifications**: Development guides provide general practices, while technical specifications detail specific implementations.
- **Memory Bank**: The Memory Bank's `techContext.md` summarizes the technical stack, while development guides provide detailed usage instructions.

## Usage Guidelines

1. Consult these guides when starting development work
2. Reference these documents during code reviews
3. Update guides when new best practices are established
4. Use these guides for onboarding new developers

## File Organization

- `/coding-standards/` - Language-specific coding standards
- `/workflows/` - Development process documentation
- `/environment/` - Setup and configuration guides
- `/testing/` - Testing strategies and practices
- `/security/` - Security implementation guidelines
- `/performance/` - Performance optimization techniques
- `/accessibility/` - Accessibility implementation guidelines

## Best Practices

- Include code examples to illustrate best practices
- Keep guides up-to-date with evolving technologies and practices
- Focus on practical, actionable guidance
- Explain the "why" behind guidelines, not just the "what"
- Use linters and automated tools to enforce standards where possible
- Review and update guides regularly based on team feedback and lessons learned

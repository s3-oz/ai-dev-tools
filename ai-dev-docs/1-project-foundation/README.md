# Project Foundation

This directory contains documentation related to the foundational aspects of the project, including goals, requirements, scope, and other fundamental information.

## Purpose

The Project Foundation documentation serves as the authoritative source for understanding:

- What the project aims to achieve
- Why the project exists
- Who the project serves
- What constraints and requirements shape the project

## Contents

This directory should contain:

- Project charter
- Vision and mission statements
- Business requirements
- Functional requirements
- Non-functional requirements
- Scope definition
- Success criteria
- Risk assessments
- Stakeholder analysis

## Relationship to Memory Bank

While the Memory Bank (in `0-memory-bank/`) contains the `projectbrief.md` file that summarizes key project information, this directory contains more detailed and comprehensive documentation about the project's foundation.

## Usage Guidelines

1. Keep all documents in this directory up-to-date as the project evolves
2. Ensure that any changes to project scope, requirements, or goals are reflected here
3. Use this directory as the reference point for resolving questions about project direction
4. Cross-reference these documents in other documentation as needed

## File Naming Conventions

- Use kebab-case for file names (e.g., `business-requirements.md`)
- Include version numbers in file names for documents that undergo significant revisions (e.g., `scope-definition-v2.md`)
- Use descriptive names that clearly indicate the content of the file

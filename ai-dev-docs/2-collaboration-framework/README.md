# Collaboration Framework

This directory contains documentation related to team collaboration, communication protocols, and workflows for effective teamwork on the project.

## Purpose

The Collaboration Framework documentation serves as the guide for:

- How team members work together
- Communication channels and protocols
- Meeting structures and schedules
- Decision-making processes
- Roles and responsibilities
- Conflict resolution approaches

## Contents

This directory should contain:

- Team structure and roles
- Communication guidelines
- Meeting templates and agendas
- Decision-making frameworks
- Collaboration tools and usage
- Onboarding procedures for new team members
- Remote work protocols (if applicable)
- Pair programming guidelines (if applicable)
- Code review processes

## Relationship to Other Documentation

- **Memory Bank**: While the Memory Bank tracks current context and progress, this directory establishes the enduring collaboration patterns.
- **Development Guides**: The collaboration framework complements development guides by focusing on human interactions rather than technical practices.

## Usage Guidelines

1. Review these documents when onboarding new team members
2. Reference these guidelines when establishing new collaborative processes
3. Update these documents as team dynamics and processes evolve
4. Use these frameworks to resolve collaboration challenges

## File Naming Conventions

- Use kebab-case for file names (e.g., `code-review-process.md`)
- Group related documents in subdirectories if needed (e.g., `meetings/`, `communication/`)
- Use descriptive names that clearly indicate the content of the file

## Best Practices

- Keep collaboration documentation concise and actionable
- Include examples and templates where appropriate
- Focus on practical guidance rather than theoretical ideals
- Update documentation based on retrospective feedback
- Ensure all team members have input into collaboration processes

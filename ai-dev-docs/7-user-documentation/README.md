## Relationship to Other Documentation

- **Project Foundation**: User documentation reflects the goals and requirements defined in the project foundation.
- **Technical Specifications**: User documentation presents user-facing aspects of technical implementations.
- **Memory Bank**: While the Memory Bank's `productContext.md` summarizes user-facing aspects, this directory provides comprehensive user documentation.

## Usage Guidelines

1. Keep user documentation up-to-date with each release
2. Write in clear, non-technical language appropriate for the target audience
3. Include visual aids such as screenshots and diagrams
4. Organize documentation by user role or task
5. Test documentation with actual users to ensure clarity and completeness

## Purpose

The Knowledge Management documentation serves as the reference for:

- Knowledge capture processes
- Documentation standards and templates
- Information architecture
- Knowledge sharing practices
- Content maintenance workflows
- Search and discovery mechanisms
- Onboarding knowledge paths

## Contents

This directory should contain:

- Documentation standards and guidelines
- Knowledge base structure and organization
- Content creation workflows
- Content review and maintenance processes
- Search and tagging strategies
- Knowledge gap analysis
- Onboarding knowledge paths
- Knowledge sharing protocols

## Relationship to Other Documentation

- **Memory Bank**: While the Memory Bank captures current context, Knowledge Management defines how knowledge is systematically organized.
- **Collaboration Framework**: Knowledge Management complements collaboration by defining how information is shared.
- **User Documentation**: Knowledge Management defines the processes that produce user-facing documentation.

## Usage Guidelines

1. Consult these documents when creating new documentation
2. Follow the defined standards for knowledge organization
3. Use the provided templates for consistent documentation
4. Reference the maintenance workflows for keeping documentation current

## File Organization

- `/standards/` - Documentation standards and guidelines
- `/templates/` - Templates for different types of documentation
- `/workflows/` - Knowledge capture and maintenance workflows
- `/architecture/` - Information architecture and organization
- `/onboarding/` - Knowledge paths for new team members

## Best Practices

- Define clear ownership for different knowledge areas
- Establish regular review cycles for documentation
- Use consistent metadata and tagging
- Create documentation as close as possible to when knowledge is generated
- Design for searchability and discoverability
- Balance comprehensive coverage with maintainability
- Consider different learning styles in knowledge presentation
- Integrate knowledge management into daily workflows

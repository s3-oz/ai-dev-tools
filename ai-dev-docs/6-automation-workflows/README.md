# Automation Workflows

This directory contains documentation related to automation workflows, scripts, and processes that streamline development, testing, deployment, and operations.

## Purpose

The Automation Workflows documentation serves as the reference for:

- CI/CD pipelines and configurations
- Build automation scripts
- Testing automation
- Deployment automation
- Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
- DevOps workflows
- Monitoring and alerting automation
- Scheduled tasks and maintenance scripts

## Contents

This directory should contain:

- CI/CD pipeline configurations
- Build script documentation
- Testing automation frameworks
- Deployment automation procedures
- Infrastructure as Code templates
- DevOps workflow documentation
- Monitoring and alerting configurations
- Scheduled task definitions
- Maintenance script documentation

## Relationship to Other Documentation

- **Operations & Deployment**: Automation workflows support the operational procedures defined in Operations & Deployment.
- **Development Guides**: Automation workflows implement the development practices defined in the guides.
- **Technical Specifications**: Automation workflows ensure consistent implementation of technical specifications.

## Usage Guidelines

1. Consult these documents when setting up or modifying automation workflows
2. Reference these configurations when troubleshooting automation issues
3. Follow these patterns when creating new automation scripts
4. Use these templates for consistent automation implementation

## File Organization

- `/ci-cd/` - CI/CD pipeline configurations and documentation
- `/build/` - Build automation scripts and documentation
- `/testing/` - Testing automation frameworks and configurations
- `/deployment/` - Deployment automation procedures and scripts
- `/infrastructure/` - Infrastructure as Code templates and documentation
- `/monitoring/` - Monitoring and alerting automation
- `/maintenance/` - Scheduled maintenance scripts and procedures
- `/templates/` - Reusable templates for automation workflows

## Best Practices

- Document the purpose and expected behavior of each automation workflow
- Include error handling and recovery procedures
- Implement appropriate logging and monitoring
- Design for idempotency where possible
- Test automation workflows thoroughly
- Version control all automation scripts and configurations
- Document dependencies and prerequisites
- Include examples of expected inputs and outputs
- Provide troubleshooting guides for common issues

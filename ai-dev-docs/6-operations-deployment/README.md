# Operations & Deployment

This directory contains documentation related to deploying, operating, monitoring, and maintaining the project in various environments.

## Purpose

The Operations & Deployment documentation serves as the reference for:

- Deployment processes and procedures
- Environment configurations
- Infrastructure setup and management
- Monitoring and alerting
- Backup and recovery procedures
- Scaling strategies
- Maintenance operations
- Incident response

## Contents

This directory should contain:

- Deployment guides
- Environment configuration specifications
- Infrastructure as Code (IaC) documentation
- Monitoring setup and dashboards
- Alerting configurations
- Backup and recovery procedures
- Scaling playbooks
- Maintenance schedules and procedures
- Incident response plans
- Runbooks for common operational tasks

## Relationship to Other Documentation

- **Technical Specifications**: Operations documentation implements the requirements defined in technical specifications.
- **Architecture & Design**: Deployment reflects the system architecture and design decisions.
- **Memory Bank**: The Memory Bank's `techContext.md` summarizes the infrastructure, while this directory provides detailed operational procedures.

## Usage Guidelines

1. Consult these documents before performing deployments or operational tasks
2. Update documentation after changes to deployment processes or infrastructure
3. Reference these guides during incident response
4. Use these documents for training operations personnel

## File Organization

- `/deployment/` - Deployment processes and procedures
- `/environments/` - Environment-specific configurations
- `/infrastructure/` - Infrastructure setup and management
- `/monitoring/` - Monitoring and alerting configurations
- `/maintenance/` - Maintenance procedures and schedules
- `/incidents/` - Incident response plans and post-mortems
- `/runbooks/` - Step-by-step guides for common operational tasks

## Best Practices

- Include detailed step-by-step procedures for critical operations
- Document environment differences and configuration parameters
- Keep infrastructure documentation in sync with actual deployments
- Include troubleshooting guides for common issues
- Document rollback procedures for all deployments
- Maintain up-to-date contact information for escalations
- Review and test procedures regularly
- Document lessons learned from incidents and operational challenges

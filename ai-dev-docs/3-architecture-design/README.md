# Architecture & Design

This directory contains documentation related to the system architecture, design patterns, and technical decisions that shape the project's implementation.

## Purpose

The Architecture & Design documentation serves as the reference for:

- System architecture and component relationships
- Design patterns and principles applied
- Technical decisions and their rationales
- Data models and schemas
- API designs and contracts
- System boundaries and integrations

## Contents

This directory should contain:

- Architecture diagrams (system-level, component-level)
- Design pattern documentation
- Data models and schema definitions
- API specifications
- Technical decision records (TDRs)
- Integration specifications
- Security architecture
- Performance considerations
- Scalability plans

## Relationship to Other Documentation

- **Memory Bank**: While the Memory Bank's `systemPatterns.md` provides a summary of key architectural patterns, this directory contains comprehensive design documentation.
- **Development Guides**: Architecture decisions inform development practices documented in the Development Guides.
- **Technical Specifications**: Architecture provides the high-level view, while Technical Specifications detail specific implementations.

## Usage Guidelines

1. Consult these documents when making design decisions to ensure consistency
2. Update architecture documentation when significant changes are made
3. Reference architecture diagrams when onboarding new team members
4. Use technical decision records to document the context and rationale for important choices

## File Organization

- `/diagrams/` - Architecture and design diagrams
- `/decisions/` - Technical decision records
- `/models/` - Data models and schemas
- `/apis/` - API specifications and contracts
- `/patterns/` - Design pattern documentation

## Best Practices

- Use standard notation for diagrams (e.g., UML, C4 model)
- Include both high-level and detailed views of the architecture
- Document the rationale behind architectural decisions
- Keep diagrams updated as the system evolves
- Use version control for tracking changes to architecture
- Include considerations for non-functional requirements (performance, security, scalability)

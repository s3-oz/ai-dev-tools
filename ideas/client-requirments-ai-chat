Use openwebUI or similar in conjution with ai to probe clients to help produce the docs we need to create websites with cline. 

This could also be used to track bugs and get feedback from the client. We could build a chantbot style component that lives in the code base and its either attached to a admin account (if the project has auth) or just shows on the dev/staging site. Maybe an .env variable to toggle the chatbot 

How we strore this could just be in the .md docs for improvments or bugs etc. Most of my prokjects moving forward might use supabase. Maybe we can have 2 supabase connections, one for the project and the other to an admin style client managment dashboard. My ai memeory workflows currenly live at project level in vscode/git so these cleint feedback docs might live in the project structrue
